            People with computers download browsers; browsers, using HTTP, send out queries and return web pages plucked from super-space-saving filing-cabinet computers called servers...hidden in air conditioned closets. <!--or warehouses! no offense meant-->
           </p>
           <p>
            These pages are usually formatted using HTML, 
            <b>hypertext markup language</b>, and can contain <em>almost anything</em>: text, images, videos, links, pdf's, multiple levels.  The browser reads the text, markup and references to turn the information into something user-friendly.
           </p>
          </div>

         <p>
           Elements are used in markup, which controls how a webp age, and its content, are rendered by the browser.  Elements consist, usually, of an <b>opening tag, content, and a closing tag</b>. Some elements, called <span class="bold">void tags</span>, don't need closing tags. 
          </p>
             <div class="code_box"> 
              Void Tags:

                Line break: &lt;br&gt; 
                and the image element: &lt;img  src="url" alt="text"&gt; 

               Non-Void Tags:
                Bold, and/or Strong: &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt;
            </div>
         <p>
            Elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.  Inline elements create no additional space around them and can "butt" right up against text.  Block elements create a box in which their content resides. 
         </p>   
              <div class="code_box">
                Line break &lt;br&gt; is inline, but paragraph &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<p>is block text</p> and created the space preceding and following the above line. 
              </div>
         <p>
            But both are necessary to manage the "white space" on an HTML page, since spaces and carriage returns are rendered null when a browser reads HTML. Multiple spaces and any carriage returns are turned into a single space.  Space, therefore, has to be deliberately coded in.
         </p>
         <p>
           Attributes, span/div
         <br>
           Attributes modify their elements, or are properties of elements. Span and Div, for instance, can have attributes added to them. Both elements contain text, Span is inline and Div is block.  Neither are void tags.  Div behaves much like the paragraph tag, but doesn't create as much space around it.

          Learning Code from Other Pages

        <p>
          Looking at the code of existing web pages provides excellent examples of code-in-action. Not only can you see the end product, but <em>how</em> the elements and style are formatted correctly to follow HTML (or CSS) syntax and rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Chrome's <b>developer tools</b> provides user-friendly ways to sift through complex HTML structure, as well as see how coders are minimizing redundancy (and errors). It's called a tool because not only can you use it, but through that use you add coding skill to your belt, so to speak.  
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML structure can be complex due to the <b>"tree-like"</b> nature of it. Within elements lie additional elements.  This causes the wavy pattern we see when looking at HTML code; the further <b>indented</b> something is, the deeper it's nested. And, when looking at the page itself, this nesting is rendered as boxes within boxes (though the borders of the boxes may be invisible).
        </p>
        <p>
         Programmer's text editors also make learning/performing programming easier.  Programs for writing programs! Or web pages, in this case.  They will, for instance, provide a corresponding closing tag for your opening one.
        </p>

          Boxes
         </div>
      <div class="notes">
        <p>
          Everything on a web page falls within the confines of a box. There's a standard model for the creation and formatting of boxes.
        </p>
          <img class ="box" src="boxmodel-image.png" alt="Box Model" style="width:304px;height:228px">
        <p>
          The padding, border, and margin all have the capability of being customized with differing sizes.  The total size of the box is from top margin to bottom, and right to left.  So, margin width (or height) plus border width plus padding width plus content width.  These values can be set in pixels, or percentages.  Percentages change with the screen size, but pixels are fixed.  If using pixels, the max width option can help maintain the integrity of a box.  Speaking of integrity, it's important to  make sure boxes will be rendered correctly across browsers.  Browser specific prefixes such as webkit, moz, and ms with the style definition will help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boxes must be positioned on the page as well.  Without defining the box values, the box will go the whole width of a page.  Using a flex box will allow boxes to sit next to each other.  Manipulating individual values will also help place boxes.  
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also helpful to think of block elements as creating boxes around them, while inline elements go within boxes.  Some box elements have to be structured within one another as well. The paragraph element, for instance, has to be within div(ision?) elements.  If you try to put a div within a paragraph, your code will not verify though the browser may be able to render it how you intended.

         CSS
     </div>
      <div class="notes">
         <p> 
           As mentioned previously, CSS controls how an HTML page <em>looks</em>.  It also saves coders substantial time by allowing them to apply a repetitive style to multiple elements of the same type.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are three ways to add style to a page:
         <br>
          1. Writing it in the head element of the HTML page. 
         <br>
          2. Within the head element, add a link to a separate CSS file. This keeps large projects organized, and looks something like this:
         </p>
            <div class="code_box">
              &lt;link: rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css"&gt;
            </div>
         <p>
          3. Writing the style inline with the HTML.  Not the best choice, leads to a lot of repetition.

         <p>
           CSS both helps avoid repetition and maintain consistency by applying a singular style to an unlimited number of instances of the same element. This, handily enough, also makes implementing changes easier. It's also ruled by an abstract concept called inheritance.  In a page of CSS code, the most specific rule applies. If a class has a specific attribute, and there's a class nested within it without any attributes specified, the nested class shares the attribute of the parent (ancestor) class.

            Variables in programming are similar to variables in algebra.  A value is assigned a designation, the name composed of <b>underscores, letters, and numbers</b> (though it can't start with a number), and until that designation is assigned another value, the name can be used in expressions to represent that value.  For the computer to understand the use of a variable, a programmer has to use an <b>assignment statement</b>.

                nanostick = speed_of_light * billionth * 100
                
                And the command "print nanostick" will direct the computer to execute the equation:
                
                299792458 * (1.0 / 1000000000) * 100

              Some benefits of using variables include improving code readability, storing a singular value of data, and a way to change that value.  The fewer times you have to write out 9 digit numbers, the fewer chances for error.

           A <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters contained within quotes--single or double.  It must start and end with the same type of quote character, but can contain the other type within it. Keep an eye on how the python interpreter changes the color when strings are inserted.  Strings can be assigned to variables.

          Strings can be added to one another, and they can be multiplied by integers, but they cannot be added to integers.  However, they can be concatenated if the number is turned into a string: <span class="code">str(n) + "string"</span>

              Errors and glitches (<b>Bugs</b>) are a normal part of programming, so the best way to minimize down-time and maximize both efficiency and productivity is to have a systematic way of finding and fixing them.  An important side note: when something doesn't behave properly, the errant code doesn't have to be useless.  Unexpected results can lead to a new way of doing something else.  Theoretically.  
             </p>
             <p> 
               Reading the actual error message will help pinpoint the mistaken code, as well as define what kind of error it is.  Further, "Googling" the error will lead to possible solutions.
             </p>
             <p>
               When re-purposing a snippet of code from another source doesn't work correctly, try commenting out the broken code and copying in the source code.  This not only makes sure that the source is viable, but allows for easy rewriting with minimized chance for error. 
             </p>
             <p>
               If code behaves oddly try adding in print statements until you come to the line that doesn't work as intended.
             </p>
             <p>
               Keep multiple versions, and check for errors as you edit.  Undo doesn't quite do the trick. A spare file will do just as well as powerful programs designed for version organization.
